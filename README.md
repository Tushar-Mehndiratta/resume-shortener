# Launching app

    $ python3 shortener.py resume.docx

## Old way -- not going to use because might have to use react native /nodejs instead

    $ source env/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

    $ export FLASK_APP=myapp
    $ export FLASK_ENV=development # enables debug mode
    $ python3 main.py

Navigate to Home page http://localhost:5000

# Business Model

# Resume Shortner: to-do list

* Language detection (English required)
* Add resume samples for testing
* Remove blank pages
* Remove excessive blank lines
* Remove excessive white space
* Adjust font face and size 
* Adjust margins
* Replace long words with shorter synonyms
* Replace month names with numbers
* Use common abbreviations (Master of Arts == MA)
* Design as mobile app (andriod/ios)

# Blaster: to-do list

* Go with affiliate marketing. It's easier for you. 
* ~~Resume-rabbit has patents, so you must target individual recruiters~~
* ~~Consider emailing resumes, instead of uploading to websites~~
* ~~If you email, you should 'cc' the applicant?~~
* ~~Consider targeting smaller recruiters (easier to deal with). Must reach out to them. Should be generalists.~~

shortener.py
--------------
This is a Python script which shortens resumes in Word XML format (docx). It shortens resumes by:

- Removing whitespace before and after the resume
- Shrinking the margins and font
- Deleting overused phrases ("References available upon request.")

It is intended to be run on the command line, on Linux/Unix and Windows.

Motivation
-------------

According to Google, a good rule of thumb is one page of resume for every ten years of work experience. 
Hard to fit it all in, right? But a three or four or ten page resume simply won't get read closely.

Installation
--------------

After cloning the repo, you need to run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage
--------------

To run:
```
python shortener.py resume.docx
```

This will produce a docx file (resume<b>-short</b>.docx) in the current working directory. The original file is untouched.
